## Purpose
In BlackJack there is an optimal move that can be made in every scenario. This BlackJack game allows the user to play against the dealer and receive feedback on every move (hit, stay, double down, etc.) that they make in the game. Additionally, the game tracks the user's play, so the user can track how often the make the optimal move and how often they win a hand.

This application can help a player identify mistakes that they are making, so they can correct them and hopefully win more money at the BlackJack table.
